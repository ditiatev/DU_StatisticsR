1. What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between `runs` and one of the other numerical variables? 
- scatterplot

2. Plot the relationship between `runs` and `at_bats`, using `at_bats` as the explanatory variable. <br> The relationship appears to be
- linear

3. Looking at your plot from the previous exercise, which of the following best describe the relationship between these two variables?
- The relationship is positive, linear, and very weak. 
One of the potential outliers is a team with approximately 5520 at bats.

4. Fit a new model that uses `homeruns` to predict `runs`.  Using the estimates from the R output, write the equation of the regression line. What does the slope tell us in the context of the relationship between success of a team and its home runs?
- For each additional home run, the model predicts 1.83 more runs, on average.

5. What is the residual for the prediction of runs for a team with 5,579 at-bats? Choose the closest answer. 
- -15.32

6. Which of the following statements about the residual plot is false? 
- <li> The residuals show a curved pattern. </li> 

7. Which of the following is true? 
- <li> The residuals are fairly symmetric, with only a slightly longer 
tail on the right, hence it would be appropriate to deem the the normal 
distribution of residuals condition met. </li>

8. Based on the residuals plot from earlier, the constant variability condition appears to be met. 
- True

9. Now that you can summarize the linear relationship between two variables, investigate the relationships between `runs` and each of the other five traditional variables. Which variable best predicts `runs`? Support your conclusion using the graphical and numerical methods we've discussed.
- <li> batting average </li>

10. Now examine the three newer variables.  These are the statistics used by the author of *Moneyball* to predict a teams success.  In general, are they more or less effective at predicting runs that the old variables?  Explain using appropriate graphical and numerical evidence.  Of all ten variables we've analyzed, which seems to be the best predictor of `runs`? 
- on-base plus slugging

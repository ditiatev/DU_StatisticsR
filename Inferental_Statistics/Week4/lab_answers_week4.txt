1) How many people were interviewed for this survey?
- A poll conducted by WIN-Gallup International surveyed 51,927 people from 57 countries.

2) Which of the following methods were used to gather information?
- All of the above

3) True / False: In the first paragraph, several key findings are reported.
These percentages appear to be sample statistics.
- True

4) True / False:The title of the report is “Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism”. 
To generalize the report’s findings to the global human population, 
We must assume that the sample was a random sample from the entire population 
in order to be able to generalize the results to the global human population. 
This seems to be a reasonable assumption.
- True // False

5) What does each row of Table 6 correspond to?
- Religions // Countries

6) What does each row of atheism correspond to?
- Countries // Religions // Individual persons

7) Next, calculate the proportion of atheist responses in the United States in 2012,
i.e. in us12. True / False: This percentage agrees with the percentage in Table~6.
- True

8) Based on the R output, what is the margin of error for the estimate 
of the proportion of the proportion of atheists in US in 2012?
- The margin of error for the estimate of the proportion of atheists in the US
 in 2012 is 0.0135.

9) Which of the following is false about the relationship between p and ME.
- The most conservative estimate when calculating a confidence interval occurs when p is set to 1.

10) True / False: There is convincing evidence that Spain has seen a change in its atheism
index between 2005 and 2012. 
- False

11) True / False: There is convincing evidence that the United States has seen a change

- True

12) If in fact there has been no change in the atheism index in the countries listed in Table 4,
 in how many of those countries would you expect to detect a change (at a significance level
 of 0.05) simply by chance? 
- 1.95

13) Suppose you’re hired by the local government to estimate the proportion of residents that attend
 a religious service on a weekly basis. According to the guidelines, the estimate must have a margin
 of error no greater than 1% with 95% confidence. You have no idea what to expect for p. How many people
 would you have to sample to ensure that you are within the guidelines? 
- At least 9604 people
